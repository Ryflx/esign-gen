- Token management system in place
- Environment configuration set up
- Template sending functionality implemented
  - Support for sending specific template with populated fields
  - Form interface for recipient details and amount input
  - Proper handling of numeric fields in templates
  - Dynamic document generation with product tables
  - Draft envelope creation and update workflow
  - Fixed recipient email preservation during envelope updates
  - Corrected envelope update method implementation
  - Enhanced template role handling with consistent signer object
  - Improved doc gen field handling with preservation of existing fields
  - Enhanced product selection UI using checkboxes
- Comprehensive API logging system implemented
  - Daily rotating log files
  - Detailed request/response logging
  - Error tracking and debugging support
  - Robust object serialization for logging
  - Proper handling of complex DocuSign objects
